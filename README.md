# CueFearConditioning
Matlab code for auditory cue-dependent fear conditioning with for example footshock stimuli. By default, this code gives 7500 and 2500 Hz pure tones and only 7500 Hz tones are associated with aversive stimuli like footshock. Information of practical footshock circuits is available here ().

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* National Intruments Daq board (http://www.ni.com/data-acquisition/)
* Matlab (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
* Data Acquisition Toolbox (https://www.mathworks.com/products/daq.html)

The code has been tested with a USB-6008, Matlab ver 8.6 (R2015b), and Data Acquisition Toolbox ver 3.5.2 (R2015b).

### Installing
* Install Matlab, Data Acquisition Toolbox, and Driver (NI-DAQmx).
* Connect your Ni Daq to your PC.
* Give your Matlab pass to the m files.

### How to use
* Day 1: adoptation
